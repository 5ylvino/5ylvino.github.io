### Coding challenge for an intermediate developer ###

Q1. Without using any library in a type-scripted bare react native app, customize ONLY ONE INPUT, which can be re-used for text and number inputs, text inputs ONLY, numbers input ONLY, select input, password input, 6 digits OTP input, date input (3boxes on YYYY, MM, DD, and output should be formatted as YYYY/MM/DD, and text Area input for skill entries ( outputted as string list ), with their respective validations for all potential cases. 


Q2a). Using your CUSTOMIZE INPUT to create a register, login, OTP, and success screen.   

Q2b). validation on register and login should be customized. And after filling in the forms it takes the user to the OTP screen. Then the user should enter any 6 digits ONLY and should automatically take the user to a dashboard/profile screen where the user's details are shown from local storage, which was stored during registration. 

Q2c). Your register form should utilize all the input types you customized earlier.   

Q2d). The design pattern should follow the sample below for registration, login, and OTP. The dashboard/profile screen should follow the profile design pattern perfectly.  

Q2c). Use the View component with the different given-colored circles as shown on the given design to build and lay out the pattern of the design. As well as the logo and other things.

Q2e). Where we have REACT NATIVE STARTER, for login and OTP, it should be INTERMEDIATE LEVEL ACTIVE.

- Your code should be concise, maintainable, and clean, and a perfectly pitched UI UX to match that of the sample design;  
- Push all changes to a repo and share the link with us when you are done on or before 24hrs elapsed. Any change, after 24hrs, you will be disqualified.
- All associate validation for different input cases as well as form cases must be fully available.
